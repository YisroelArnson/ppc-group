    <h1>Terms of Service for ThePPCGroup</h1>
    <p>
      These Terms of Service and the conditions listed below apply to

      ThePPCGroup, WWW.ThePPCGroup.Com, and all products/services and work-

      product offered or delivered by ThePPCGroup, and the conditions concerning your

      use of and access to the ThePPCGroup website. By accessing, using, or

      downloading any materials or content from the website, or receiving any of the same

      via email, you agree to follow and will be bound by all conditions included in this

      document. If you do not agree with these Terms you may not use our products,

      services, work-product, and/or website.
    </p>

    <h3>Use Provisions</h3>
    <p>
      Internet Services, Content, Products, and Accuracy of Data: We make a reasonable

      effort to ensure that information on this website and any delivered or posted work-

      product is complete, accurate, and current. However, due to the nature of the

      information we gather (and its sources) it may be inaccurate, incomplete, or out of

      date. We make no guarantees as to the accuracy or completeness of any

      information expressed on our website, emails, work-product, recommendations,

      evaluations, or conclusions. All features, content, product descriptions, product

      pricing, services, and statements of said products and services described or

      displayed on this website, verbally, or via fax or email, are subject to change at any

      time without notice. ThePPCGroup regularly attempts to accurately display all

      aspects of our products and services. However, the nature and sprawling scope of

      the internet make the constant accuracy of information, and the ability to be aware of

      all ongoing changes, impossible.
    </p>

    <h3>Order Confirmations</h3>
    <p>
      It is our practice to confirm orders by email receipt. Receiving said email binds the

      recipient to their obligations as outlined in the Billing and Payments Section included

      in this agreement. Receiving an email receipt does NOT constitute an agreement

      beyond the specified details contained in the email and any attachments to the

      email. You may request a receipt be mailed to you. If you do not receive a receipt by

      mail your emailed copy will serve as your formal receipt. Anyone &quot;logging in&quot; to our

      client side or having received an email confirming the contracting of services with

      ThePPCGroup, confirms that they have received a receipt and will be bound by the

      terms and conditions regarding Billing and Payments below. We reserve the right

      without prior notice and at our discretion to refuse service to any customer along

      with access to the website by any visitor or customer should it be used

      inappropriately or beyond the scope of what ThePPCGroup deems acceptable.

      Furthermore, ThePPCGroup reserves the right to no longer provide services to any

      customer/client where in the sole judgment of ThePPCGroup, there is not a good

      working relationship, or ThePPCGroup feels it cannot benefit the customer/client,

      because of the nature of their business, their target market, their customer base,

      their geographic location, or any other reason, in the sole judgement of

      ThePPCGroup.
    </p>

    <h3>Materials and Content</h3>

      federal laws designed to protect copyrights, trademarks, and intellectual capital. It is

      the client&#39;s responsibility to comply with the laws governing their use of the website

      and protect their personal information (specifically account username / password)

      along with the confidentiality of their information that may be displayed. You agree to

      accept responsibility for all activities that occur with-in your account and will NOT

      hold ThePPCGroup liable should the account (or its data) be compromised by an

      We reserve the right without prior notice and at our discretion to refuse service to

      any customer along with access to the website by any visitor or customer should it

      be used inappropriately or beyond the scope of what ThePPCGroup deems

      acceptable. Furthermore, ThePPCGroup reserves the right to no longer provide

      services to any customer/client where in the sole judgment of ThePPCGroup, there

      is not a good working relationship, or ThePPCGroup feels it cannot benefit the

      customer/client, because of the nature of their business, their target market, their

      customer base, their geographic location, or any other reason, in the sole judgement

      of ThePPCGroup.
