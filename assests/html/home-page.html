              The advantage of PPC is Three-Fold:
              1 - (When done right): Immediacy.
              2 – Hyper-Targeting of the right customers/Audience
              3 – In concert with #2, Efficiency – Spending money as efficiently as possible by getting the right ads in front of the right
              people, as opposed to mass advertising that is guaranteed to reach a lot of “people”, but perhaps none that are in the
              market for your product/service.
              Search Engine Marketing (SEM)/Pay-per- Click (PPC) offers the ability to instantly achieve exposure for your product or
              service in front of the most likely customers to make a purchase.
              The best analogy is watering crops. The old way: Spray thousands of gallons of water in the air over the crops, but most of
              it evaporated in the air, and never made it to the roots where needed. Modern Tech: Drip Hoses, with a small hole right at
              the root of each plant.
              Efficient drips of water now accomplish what took thousands of gallons of wasted resources before. The result:
              Exceedingly high ROI’s.

            <p>
              Each Campaign for your product/service is individually custom crafted, after an extremely thorough analysis of your target

              consumer base, customer profile, geographic considerations, and goals.

              Similarly, Ads and Landing Pages are hand crafted to achieve the most efficient use of your advertising dollars.

              Extremely detailed keyword research, structuring, and evaluation is, well…The Key.

              In conjunction with well written Ads and specifically composed Landing Pages, ThePPCGroup performs an entire process

              of investigating and researching the exact keywords that will optimally perform for each of your campaigns, and in

              conjunction with each of you ad groups.

              Once a campaign is launched, then there is rigorous ongoing evaluation and reevaluation to constantly hone and improve

              campaign or Ad Group.

            <p>
              One of the most successful conversion tools in SEM is Remarketing visitors to the website. Like the keyword aspect, this

              involves building different Campaigns that target based on the behavior or telltale signs of each visitor to your website.

              Most customers do not make a buying decision on their first visit to a website. Deploying remarketing campaigns to keep

              your presence in front of them is a vital tool to achieve sales.

              The benefits of the new social-media, wired world cut both way. While it allows you to reach everyone, it also allows

              everyone to reach you. Significantly, depending on your product and business model, you may meet your customers face to

              face. Bad reviews live on to eternity on the Web. The more scathing the review, the less significant it becomes that it’s ten

              years old.

              It’s vital to have a process in place to communicate with your customers, resolve any issues, and defuse any brewing

              trouble. Likewise, a site choked full of good reviews both improves your evaluations in the eyes of Google and potential

              customers, that use reviews to evaluate the risk, or lack of, in buying your company’s products.
