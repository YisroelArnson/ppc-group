    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>
      ThePPCGroup® (“ThePPCGroup”) respects your privacy rights and has developed this Privacy Policy to allow you to

      understand and protect your privacy rights.  By continuing your use of our website, you agree to abide by all of the

      terms and conditions of this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Use.
    </p>

    <h3>Use of Personally Identifiable Information</h3>
    <p>
      You are not required to give us any information about yourself in order to use this website except for gaining

      access to certain portions of this website that will be made clear to you.  If you contact us and choose to provide

      personally identifiable information to us, including your name, address, phone number and email address, or you

      choose to gain access to the portions of this website that require you to give personally identifiable information

      about yourself, you will be considered to have consented to our use and disclosure of that information as set forth

      in this Privacy Policy, including the use and disclosure of that information by our successors and assigns.  Our use

      may include contacting you by mail, telephone, or email regarding your interest in our products and services.  We

      may have a process in the future for you to review, revise, or delete the information that you provide to us

      through our website. If that access is not available through the web site, please contact us by clicking on the

      “Contact” link.<br /> <br />

      We will take reasonable precautions to protect your personally identifiable information. We follow generally

      accepted industry security standards to safeguard and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security,

      and correctly use such information.  While we strive to use modern and reasonable means to protect your

      personally identifiable information, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of that information during its

      transmission or its storage on our systems.<br /><br />

      We may provide your personally identifiable information to outside companies for the purpose of conducting

      customer or market research on our behalf in order to improve our products and services. We will, however, not

      sell your information to any third party. You have the option of &quot;opting-out&quot; of such use of your information by

      contacting us as indicated below. We will also release information about you if we believe that we are required by

      law to do so.
