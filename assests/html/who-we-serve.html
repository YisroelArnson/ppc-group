            Once upon a time, the Yellow Pages dominated the advertising world of search-by-category.<br /><br /> While TV and radio was present for “mass” unfocused advertisements to the general public, the Yellow Pages allowed a motivated consumer that was knew the product or service they were looking for, to specifically search for a company by specific topic.<br /><br />

            Today, online search is the Yellow Pages on steroids and high voltage, strapped to a Jetpack!!<br /><br /> In a fraction of one single second of time, Google or Bing will search through 7,000,000 or 15,000,000+ websites, advertisements, and blogs, and return all those results ranked by the greatest likelihood of relevance to your search.<br /><br />

  <h1>What We Do For You and Your Business?</h1><br /><br />
  <p>
    It’s hard to overstate the incredible opportunity that SEM (Search Engine Marketing) and PPC (Pay-per-Click) bring to small and medium businesses.<br /><br />

    It’s a remarkable leveler of the playing field. When a small to medium company, hires an experienced Pay-per-Click company such as ThePPCGroup to craft a well-coordinated and integrated SEM (Search Engine Marketing) campaign, in conjunction with an attractive website, a company with $20K or $250K or $2MM in annual revenues, can directly compete for the eyes and attention of relevant customers.<br /><br />

    Billy Wildebeest Barbeque Sauce (that all his relatives have been telling him to bottle and market for years) can now compete with Kraft or any best seller out there…. Cakes, muffins, accounting, packaging, supplies, sealants, bolts, shampoo, blush, shoes, catheters, walk-in-tubs…<br /><br />

    Platforms such as Google AdWords and Bing provide an indescribable opportunity for your business, your product, or your service, if you put together a tightly integrated campaign of well written PPC ads, Keywords, and Landing Pages.<br /><br />

    85%+ of all Internet Marketing based sales come from people clicking on the top 2 to 3 ads. There was a joke I saw once on a YouTube video…Where’s the best place to hide a body? On page 2 of an AdWords search…<br /><br />

    Whether you are advertising on Google AdWords, Bing, Yahoo, of any other online marketing and search engine technology, you need a solid internet/online marketing agency, and talented internet marketing specialists, that are experts in understanding the pay-per-click model.<br /><br />

    That requires the crafting of an online marketing campaign that entails the right selection of quality crafted, on-target keywords, tightly coordinated wording on your PPC online ads, and the same tight integration of your web pages and landing pages, so that you get the customers you want, but don’t get customers that are not really looking for your product or service.<br /><br />

    Expertise and finesse in Search Engine Marketing and Pay per Click is a mix of both technological proficiency, and marketing savvy. It entails getting in the head of your most likely customers as they enter search terms in a Google AdWords, Bing, or Yahoo search engine to find the products or services they are looking for.<br /><br />

    ThePPCGroup will evaluate your Website and Landing Pages to evaluate whether you are currently integrated properly in your current Pay per click (PPC) and Search Engine Marketing (SEM) campaigns. Do you have a consistency and uniformity in your PPC ad campaign, your PPC online marketing, and your search advertising.<br /><br />

    If you’ve never done this before, we walk you through an overview of the process, roll-up our sleeves with you, and start building a great campaign to bring you customers and sales.<br /><br />

    You need n experienced web marketing agency like ThePPCGroup, to structure these PPC elements so they perform efficiently on AdWords and Bing.<br /><br />

    As part of our trial program, we offer several key set-up and campaign design elements and will prove performance before you pay is a penny! We will build a working PPC Campaign that performs and proves its worth.<br /><br />

    Many companies want to trap you into long-term commitments, and won’t lift a finger until you’ve spent a lot of money.<br /><br />

    We believe the model should work exactly the opposite. We are willing to prove our worth before you pay us a penny. We are that confident in our performance, and our goal is to build a long-term, mutually beneficial relationship with you that you will be happy with for years to come, as we help your business grow and succeed.<br /><br />

    Give is a call and we’ll discuss your goals, where you’re starting out, and where you want to get to. There’s no commitment and no requirements. Just a casual discussion to see if there’s a good fit and a meeting of the minds.<br /><br />

    We look forward to the opportunity to speak with you.<br /><br />
